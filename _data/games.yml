      I wrote Slippy's Adventure around Christmas time. Slippy is lost in the middle of winter, he's cold and wants to go home... but red circles are appearing to shoot at him.

      Bounce off the walls, collect powerups, shoot giant centipedes (or are you just really small)

      StarrySky is a One Script Game&trade;. As in, I completely ignored all the nice parts of Game Maker and wrote it all in one script in one object event.

      This is the first game I made without Game Maker, instead using C#. The framerate timer's precision is too low, and my dad wrote the level XML parser.

      PickUpBlock was inspired by the TI calculator game Block Dude. I wrote it for a mission on RoboSquid, a now-defunct game development community. I was never entirely sure if the puzzle difficulty level was balanced at all because I wrote the puzzles...

      This is another attempt at a <a href="#vkec">VKEC</a>-style game. It's shinier?

      I made this game with a couple of friends for a <a href="http://tsaweb.org">Technology Student Association</a> competition. It's a spin-off of Oregon Trail, based on H. Rider Haggard's book King Solomon's Mines. It made it to nationals, but I think that reflects more on Utah's competition that year than anything.

      So, how can you get any better than rockets <em>and</em> sharks!? With explosions and torpedos and a submarine!
