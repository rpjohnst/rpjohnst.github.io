Hi, it's me, Russell Johnston. Here are some things I'm currently working on:

* [Dejavu](https://dejavu.abubalay.com/) is a reimplementation of classic versions of [Game Maker](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) for fun and preservation. A previous attempt, built on LLVM, lives [here](https://github.com/rpjohnst/dejavu-llvm).
* [Visual Studio C++](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/features/cplusplus/). At Microsoft, I'm on the team that handles IntelliSense (autocomplete, navigation, etc.).
* [The Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a competitor to C and C++ with compile-time memory safety, an ML-like type system, and an excellent community.

Here are some projects I've been involved with in the past:

* [Spice](https://team-worm.github.io/spice/) was my senior project at the University of Utah. It's a C debugger that visualizes control flow and data structures across time.
* [SQLite Tracer](https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlite-tracer) is a profiling tool from my time as an intern at Microsoft.
* [ENIGMA](https://enigma-dev.org/) is an open source game engine fusing Game Maker and C++.
* I've spent a lot of time [designing small games](/games), though they aren't hosted anywhere at the moment.
